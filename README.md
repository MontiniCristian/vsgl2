Very Simple Graphic Library 2

This library is built upon the very well known SDL library: the goal is to introduce beginners into graphical programming, giving a set of functions in pure C (more or less).

The library is cross-platform, so it could be used in Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Design
Main features:
- Simple, every functions has to be clear and easy to use
- Only functions, not classes or objects (from the user prospective, the library code uses C++)
- Not a general library to do all the things, but only to do certain things in a easy manner. If you want to have full control of all the aspects, maybe it could be better to use SDL instead.


## Lessons
Very often programming library has a not so good documentation, sometimes because it is too difficult to follow, sometimes because it lacks in explaining fundamental parts.

During the development of this library the idea is to add "lessons" to explain how to use the functionalities of this library through examples. [Go to the lessons](lessons/)

## Contributing
Any help will be appreciated, some examples:
- Adding new code to the library
- Adding lessons to clarify some aspects or only to give inspiration
- I'm not a native speaker (I think it is clear), so corrections will be welcomed. 
- Anything useful.
